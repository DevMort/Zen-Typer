* Zen Typer

** Why I Made It
As of typing this, I am in the process of learning a new keyboard layout (colemak). And I need a helper program that I can just mindlessly type away while some of my focus is on another thing (like a movie or something).

** TODO
1. Show next word.
2. Scale font size based on the monitor size.

** Status
It's a minimum viable product now.
